intro-node.js
=============

This project is a game in which there are two players.  One of them will be drawing something and the other player must guess what they draw.  The roles of each player switch after every round.

The project uses node.js and express to run the web server and socket.io to allow players to communicate with eachother.


A working version of this project can be found at nabergh.herokuapp.com.
